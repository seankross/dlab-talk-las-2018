# Tipping the Scale: A Synthesis of Online Learning Strategies

### Sean Kross

### 2018-01-10

I gave this talk to the UC San Diego Design Lab in order to get feedback about
ideas I had synthesized from reading every paper from
[Learning at Scale](learningatscale.acm.org). My intention was to write a
synthesis paper about the first four years of the conference.
